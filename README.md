Hi ðŸ‘‹!

I'm Guille. Welcome to my small digital niche.

In my over 10 years of experience, I have developed my entire professional career as a Data Scientist in Spain and London. During my journey, I have worked in research in both academia and industry, led the development of the recommendation and personalization capabilities at Tesco, the largest supermarket in the UK, and built the data function from scratch at Bother, a London-based e-commerce startup. I has also been fortunate to have companies trusting me as an external data advisor to help them make decisions trying to steer their data science projects in the right direction. 

Right now, I'm currently focused on [Zrive](zriveapp.com), building an ed-tech platform dedicated to empowering individuals to acquire new skills, advance their careers, and expand their professional networks outside the traditional educational institutions.
