Hi, I'm Guille ðŸ‘‹!

This is the brain dump where I save most of the Data related posts that I share in RRSS.

My main goal with this content is to share my own knowledge and experience to help others bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world practical applications. 

I hope you find it useful. Thanks your joining me!


## My professional career in a nutshell

For those who doesn't know me, I thought I'd share a little bit more about my professional career.

I have developed my career as a Data Scientist over the last 10 years in Spain and London, both in startups and large corporations.

During this time, I have worked in research in both academia and industry, led the development of the recommendation and personalization capabilities at Tesco, the largest supermarket in the UK, and built the data function from scratch at Bother, a London-based e-commerce startup. 

I have also helped companies making decisions and steering their data science projects, as an external data advisor. 

Right now, I'm currently focused on [Zrive](zriveapp.com), building an ed-tech platform dedicated to empower individuals to acquire new skills, advance their careers, and expand their professional networks outside the traditional educational institutions.
